# Weather Now (Open‑Meteo)

Overview
- A minimal, client‑side web page to fetch current temperature and humidity for a city using the Open‑Meteo API.
- Built with Bootstrap 5 for a clean, responsive UI. No build tools or keys required.

Setup
- Option 1: Just open index.html in any modern browser.
- Option 2: Serve statically (recommended for local development), e.g.:
  - Python: python3 -m http.server
  - Node: npx http-server

Usage
- Enter a city name (e.g., “Berlin”, “New York”) and click “Get Weather”.
- The page geocodes the city and displays current temperature and relative humidity.
